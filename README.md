Welcome! <br>
I'm delighted to welcome you to my GitHub portfolio, a curated showcase of my journey and accomplishments in the realms of data science and business analytics. As a dedicated Bachelor's student at Macquarie University specializing in Business Analytics, I am deeply immersed in exploring the synergy between analytics and business strategy. Here, you'll find a collection of projects demonstrate my technical proficiency and my passion for transforming complex datasets into insightful, actionable knowledge. 
I'm constantly expanding my skillset and will be uploading new projects soon. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss my work on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnav-sharma-8a9a4b192/
